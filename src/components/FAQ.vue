Group Income is a small solution to a larger scale problem.
            We're providing a tool that helps you support the ones closest to you, through a voluntary basic income system, without the need for governmental action or approval.`,

          question: 'Why is Group Income a voluntary system?',
          answer: `One of the primary arguments for Basic Income is the notion that it is <a class="link" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-03/for-fighting-poverty-cash-is-surprisingly-effective" target="_blank">better to give people money than vouchers</a> because <a class="link" href="http://www.cgdev.org/publication/cash-or-coupons-testing-impacts-cash-versus-vouchers-democratic-republic-congo-working" target="_blank">people make better decisions about what they can and should do with their money</a> than the state (or donor) can make for them. However, a government-based Basic Income program would take other people's money against their will because it, supposedly, knows better than they do what to do with it.<br><br>When in the mindset of a "net giver", even basic income advocates often ask the same questions about fairness that everyone asks upon hearing they'll be giving money to others. These questions, for some reason, aren't asked when people talk about Basic Income on a national level, because most view the issue from the reference point of a net beneficiary.<br><br>These questions of fairness can be addressed by making a voluntary basic income system. Some examples of voluntary basic income systems are:<br>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Permanent_Fund" class="link" target="_blank">Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend</a> (resource-based)</li>

            <li>Group Income (voluntary monetization of human labor)</li>
            <li>City sales tax (where freedom of motion is feasible)</li>
          </ul>`,
          active: false

          question: 'Why is Group Income decentralized?',
          answer: `Group Income is a project of the okTurtles Foundation, a non-profit that supports beneficial decentralization technologies. The original goal of Group Income was to make open-source software sustainable. We wanted to make it possible for developers to produce high quality, open-source software, and still be able to provide for their families.<br><br>
            We find decentralized software development vital for the future of society. We don't agree, nor want to perpetuate, the <a class="link" href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10625-businesses-collecting-data.html" target="_blank">way most companies, as well as big data and data brokers</a>, are currently using data to manipulate or tamper with people's will. With a decentralized system on Group Income, groups don't need to trust a centralized "service provider". Groups will be able to be self-governing, and will also only make decisions for themselves.<br><br>
            This means that, besides helping you reach basic security, we also want you to be in control of your security and privacy online. We recognize that your data belongs to you, and we are not entitled to it.<br><br>

        }, {
          question: 'Why would people who earn more than a basic income want to give any of it away?',
          answer: `Group members can limit their monetary contributions, so they don't need to give away more than they are comfortable giving. Group members want to help each other reach the mincome threshold because groups are better when people support each other. When other group members are miserable and struggling, that impacts the quality of life of each group member. Likewise, when the society around you is miserable, that will impact your quality of life as well.
            Let's take the example of <a class="link" href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html" target="_blank">Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</a>. It argues that the needs lower in the hierarchy (like food, water, warmth, security, or safety) need to be satisfied before individuals can attempt to focus on needs higher up. If basic needs aren't met, individuals will never move to the next level of needs. When someone decides to contribute to a group and help members achieve basic security, they're helping their loved ones climb the ladder and attempt to reach their full potential. This can translate into a group of altruistic, trusting, creative, and confident people that boost and improve each other's existence. Who wouldn't want to be a part of that?`,

          question: 'This sounds like communism.',
          answer: `This is not communism. One reason communism failed is because power was centralized, which led to a small group making decisions for everyone, and concentration/abuse of power.<br><br>
            Group Income is decentralized, which ensures that each group is making decisions only for itself and that no one will have power over that group.`,

          question: 'What does Group Income do or enable that the government doesn\'t?',
          answer: `It's not easy to jump-start basic income. Pilot studies don't last long. So far, there have not been any sustainable implementations providing a basic income, in part because people argue about political implementation details, like taxation.<br><br>
            <a class="link" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basic-income.asp" target="_blank">Universal Basic Income gained momentum in 2020</a> during Andrew Yang's presidential campaign, but it still isn't in a near-term future. Group Income does not require political discussion or nationwide acceptance. It gives people the authority to choose what they wish to do with their income, rather than having a third party making decisions for them. It is also more efficient than any government system because there's no bureaucracy, no policies, and no conflicting laws.`,
          active: false
        }, {
          question: 'What about deadbeats and freeloaders?',
          answer: `Each group will have a mechanism for removing members, just as there will be a mechanism for approving new members. Additionally, Group Income is a completely voluntary system, meaning that any group member can voluntarily leave their group at any time.<br><br>
            We understand that the risk of deadbeats or freeloaders on a group may be a real concern for users. That being said, we expect this risk to be rare, as guaranteed basic income programs and <a class="link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227387994_The_Town_with_No_Poverty_The_Health_Effects_of_a_Canadian_Guaranteed_Annual_Income_Field_Experiment" target="_blank">studies have shown</a>, in contrast to public opinion, that people with a guaranteed income only slightly reduce their workload, rather than stop working at all.

            Group Income is voluntary for members, and donations to the development team are voluntary as well. When setting up your group, you decide what mincome the dev team gets after the group's basic income is met.
            You can find the "Group Income Developers Group" on the {donate?} tab in your {user|group profile}. The "Group Income Developers Group" default mincome will be $x, but if you don't think the default is fair (too low or too high), we encourage you to change it.
            If you believe Group Income is a project that should succeed, you can reflect that in the amount you choose. The money earned will be put directly back into development and support of Group Income so we can continue providing the tools you need to just set it and forget it!`,
