      <h3>
        Acceptance of Terms
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Group Income website and app ("Services") are a project of okTurtles Foundation Inc. ("okTurtles"), a 501(c)(3) non-profit registered in the State of Florida, USA.
      </p>
      <p>
        By accessing and using Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"), and our <a href={resolvePath('/privacy-policy')} class="is-link">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use our Services.
      </p>
      <h3>Disclaimer of Warranty and Liability</h3>
      <p>Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. The Services are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. okTurtles expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
      <p>okTurtles and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses resulting from the use or inability to use the Services, or any unauthorized access to or alteration of your data.</p>
      <p>
        TO THE EXTENT WHICH IS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN YOUR JURISDICTION, OKTURTLES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE PROVIDED BY OKTURTLES OR AN OKTURTLES REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY CHANGE THE TERMS OF THIS WARRANTY. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIRS, OR CORRECTIONS. 
      </p>
      <p>TO THE EXTENT WHICH IS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN YOUR JURISDICTION, IN NO EVENT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, SHALL OKTURTLES BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, DIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, COSTS, OR LOSSES, EVEN IF OKTURTLES HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL OKTURTLES'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES EXCEED THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE, EXCEPT AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN CASES INVOLVING PERSONAL INJURY.</p>

      <h3>Data and Security</h3>
      
      <p>While okTurtles strives to protect the security and integrity of your data (and, in our opinion, have gone <a href={resolvePath('/privacy-policy')} class="is-link">above and beyond in this regard</a>), we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Services. Any transmission of data is at your own risk. okTurtles shall not be liable for any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of your data.</p>
      
      <h3>Third-party Servers</h3>

      <p>If you are using Group Income on a third-party server (one not hosted by us), please be advised that we have absolutely no control over that server, we cannot guarantee its integrity, we cannot guarantee that it's running the same code, we are not responsible for anything on it, and you should only use servers run by someone you trust.</p>
      <p>We maintain a list of third-party servers on our website, but we cannot verify the integrity of any of them. Only use a server you trust, or run your own. We will remove any server from the list for which we receive a lawful order.</p>

      <h3>Jurisdiction and Governing Law</h3>

      <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. Any legal action or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services shall be instituted exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Miami-Dade, Florida, and you expressly consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>
