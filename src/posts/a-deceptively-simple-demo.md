# A Deceptively Simple Demo

Our goal for Group Income was to not just get the UI right, but [to get the architecture right too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I381R5_joLE&list=PLRcgABNc9s2R3gSfRG7jHzb4giQdxaDB7&index=3).

Creating secure, decentralized, user-friendly, open-source software is hard. After many years of development, it's finally time for a demo of the UI.

What's really cool about this demo is that it can work for groups even in the absence of an Internet connection, or in the presence of a heavily censored Internet connection.

In future posts we will go into more detail about the architecture and how Group Income works under the hood.

Want to help us get Group Income to you faster?

You can also make a direct **[tax-deductible donation to the okTurtles Foundation](https://okturtles.org/donate/).**

### Bulgaria Hackathon

A lot of what you see in that video was implemented during our Bulgaria Hackathon last year, and that post is still coming up.

### Want contribute?

We're looking for volunteers & contractors!

- Translators (all languages!)
- Open position: [Veteran JavaScript developer to assist with backend and protocol work](/positions/)

**[Get in touch with us!](https://groupincome.org/community/)**

All significant contributors will become members of the Group Income Contributors group, which will provide its members with a basic income! If you live in a country with basic income, that's a basic income on top of a basic income! If like most of us you live in a country without basic income, one basic income is better than zero.
