Besides the video player, this release introduces many important bugfixes and improvements, see the full list below.

Group Income now speaks 9 languages.

You can now use Group Income in **Korean**, **Chinese**, **Japanese**, **Spanish**, **Portuguese**, **German**, **Russian**, and **Ukrainian** (we already had **French**!)
