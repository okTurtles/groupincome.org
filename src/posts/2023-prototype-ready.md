It's been quite a journey, but we're finally here. A [new kind of software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I381R5_joLE&list=PLRcgABNc9s2R3gSfRG7jHzb4giQdxaDB7&index=3) is ready for testing.

If you have a group of friends/family that's interested in supporting one another using monetary and non-monetary means, you're a perfect fit to try out the Group Income prototype, and we want to hear from you!

### What makes Group Income unique

- Group Income is a simple tool to calculate and distribute a minimum income for a group of friends.
- A voluntary approach that provides a social safety net that requires no political campaigning.
- Use any currency you'd like — cryptocurrency, fiat, it doesn't matter.
- Empowers people to become the change they want to see in the world.
- Helps individuals buffer each other against life catastrophes in societies with poorly functioning social safety nets.
- Gives people more freedom to experiment with new, innovative ideas without taking on massive debt.
- Powered by [a fundamentally different non-Big Tech software architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I381R5_joLE&list=PLRcgABNc9s2R3gSfRG7jHzb4giQdxaDB7&index=3) that supports a federated approach.[^1] Think [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)/[@-protocol](https://atproto.com/) but end-to-end encrypted[^2] and smart-contract based (no blockchains required).
- No eyeballs or biometrics needed!  👁🙅‍♂️ Sybil-attacks are impossible thanks to its design (more on this in a future blog post!)

[^1]: We will be releasing this publicly so that anyone can create apps like Group Income. Follow our <a href="https://groupincome.org/community/" target="_blank">socials</a> / <a href="https://okturtles.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=bacb6eb127dd649ee5a8ff399&id=707996fda6" target="_blank">email list</a> to know when it's released!

[^2]: The beta will have encryption disabled. End-to-end encryption is working for 80% of the app's features. We are putting on the final touches.

### What's Next For Group Income

This week we will be in Chicago demoing Group Income to attendees of [the BIG Conference](https://www.thebigconference.org/). If you're there in person you'll have the opportunity to try out Group Income first-hand.

And in two weeks we will be announcing and presenting our end-to-end encrypted, decentralized protocol at the [DWeb Camp 2023](https://dwebcamp.org/), so get your tickets now! 😄
