### Node.js Developer
(Senior/Mid or Promising Junior)

Are you an expert at JavaScript? Know the language and tools inside-out? Been programming for at least 4 years? Know several programming languages? Great! You might be a fit for this position. 🙂

##### Required attributes

*   JavaScript expert and able to prove it.
*   Experience with Node.js.
*   Minimum 4 years of programming experience using more than one programming language.
*   Excited to learn new tools and new ways of programming.
*   Are able to get up and running with Group Income development because you find the instructions trivial to follow.
*   Know how to submit pull requests.
*   Are self-taught and are constantly pushing yourself to expand your knowledge and skillset.
*   You are not intimidated by anything written above.
*   Able to commit at least 15 hours per week for the next 6 months or so.
*   Are excited by what we’re creating.

##### Nice-to-have

*   Familiarity with Hapi.js web framework, or the ability to pick it up quickly
*   Familiarity with web sockets, or the ability to pick them up quickly
*   Understanding of infosec is a major plus!

##### What to expect

Have a look at our Github Project and existing pull requests. Our development process involves in-depth review and testing to catch as many bugs as we can before any code makes its way into user’s hands to ensure the highest level of quality. Be prepared for potentially multiple rounds of PR reviews, and be prepared to also review other people’s code.

##### Compensation

*   In Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Zcash (ZEC) or Monero (XMR) preferred (most of our donations are crypto). We can pay in USD if there is no other way.
*   Everyone who contributes meaningful work to the project will be added to the Group Income Developers group for 1 year following its launch, which will provide a mincome of some amount to its members. There will be around 7 to 10 reserved, lifetime\* seats that will be given to the top contributors to Group Income as of its 1.0 launch. About 5 or 6 of these seats have already been locked in for existing contributors to date.

A lifetime seat means that person cannot be voted out of the group.
