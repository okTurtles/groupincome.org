### Social Media Marketer

We're looking for a "professional sh*t poster" who has nothing better to do than sit on social media and post a few times per day in reaction to various project-related events in a semi-professional (but funny) manner. We'll pay you for it.

##### Required Attributes

1. Loves the idea of Group Income and is excited about what we're doing.
2. People person. Happy to interact in a positive way with the community.
3. Funny, Talented, and Creative.
4. Are able to manage multiple social network accounts, at least on Fediverse, X, and BlueSky.

##### Compensation

- Negotiated hourly rate paid in cryptocurrency.

##### What to expect

1.  Use the nav bar to look through the pages on this website (maybe watch some videos, read some posts). Decide whether this project excites you. We’re only looking for people who are genuinely interested/excited in what we’re creating.
2.  Proceed to Application Instructions below and apply as soon as you can.

#### Application Instructions

*   Send an email to hi@okturtles.org telling us:

    1.  Your marketing background, including examples of past work.
    2.  Why you think you'd be good at this job.
    3.  What, if anything, you think you might have trouble with (be honest).
    4.  Link(s) to portfolio(s) or work, if you have any.
    5.  Any questions/concerns you have.
    6.  3 real examples of any type of marketing content you'd make for us (whether it's a tweet, an AI video, a song, a blog post, a reaction to some current event, whatever).
    7.  How soon you’ll be able to start.

*   Install [Keybase](https://keybase.io) and send a copy of that email to [greg](https://keybase.io/greg).

Please follow all instructions if you'd like a reply.

We should respond back within a week or so of receiving your application (depending on how many responses we’ve received so far).
