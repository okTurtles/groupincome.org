### Volunteering

Most of the people who work on Group Income do so as volunteers. We’re looking for designers, developers, and writers. Feel free to hop right in and join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/okturtles/shared_invite/zt-jc5x4uck-0YqMX5vVGZ9koR2b6LCwiw) and [Github](https://github.com/okTurtles/group-income)!

#### Bounties

You can also get paid to work on Group Income without applying for a specific position by working on issues that [have bounties posted to them](https://github.com/okTurtles/group-income-simple/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ANote%3ABounty) or ask us [on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/okturtles/shared_invite/zt-jc5x4uck-0YqMX5vVGZ9koR2b6LCwiw) if we can add a bounty to an issue you're interested in.

Every regular contributor to the development of Group Income will be added to the Group Income Contributors Group, a special group for Group Income contributors that’s sustained by voluntary contributions from the larger network of groups.
